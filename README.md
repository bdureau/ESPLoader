# ESPLoader
This is a partial Java port of the ESP loader from 
https://github.com/espressif/esptool

I also got it to run on Android for my Rocket altimeter application
https://github.com/bdureau/BearConsole2/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/altimeter/bdureau/bearconsole/Flash

Currently this has been successfully been tested on ESP32, ESP32 WROOMM, TTGO, LILYGO T-QT, ESP32S3, ESP32C3
