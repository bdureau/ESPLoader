# ESPLoader
This is a partial Java port of the ESP loader from 
https://github.com/espressif/esptool

To my knowledge this is the only Java port of the esptool

I also got it to run on Android for my Rocket altimeter application
https://github.com/bdureau/BearConsole2/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/altimeter/bdureau/bearconsole/Flash

Currently this has been successfully been tested on 

ESP32

ESP32 WROOM

TTGO

LILYGO T-QT

ESP32S3

ESP32C3 

ESP8266

ESP32S2

ESP32H2

ESP32C6 

ESP32 C2 needs to be tested waitting for Espressif to release it on the Arduino environement

If you want to make it works for other chips check the following web page to modify the protocol
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32s3/advanced-topics/serial-protocol.html
select the chip you are using to see which codes you need to send
I do not have all the chips to test them, drop me a note if you need help


I have provided some test firmwares that can be flashed to your board
